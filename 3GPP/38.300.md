| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full Name   | Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing                       | Cyclic Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing      |

**Numerology**
- Numerology defines subcarrier spacing (SCS) and associated OFDM parameters.

| OFDM Parameter  | Impact                                                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Symbol duration | $T_{sym} \propto \frac{1}{\text{SCS}}$; larger SCS → shorter symbols |
| FFT size        | At fixed bandwidth, larger SCS → smaller FFT size                    |
| Slot length     | 14 symbols per slot; larger μ → shorter slot                         |
| CP length       | Related to symbol duration; larger SCS → shorter CP                  |
| TTI granularity | Larger μ → finer time granularity → faster system reaction           |

## 5.2 Downlink
- PDSCH（Physical Downlink Shared Channel）+ DMRS（Demodulation Reference Signal）
- DMRS (Demodulation Reference Signal)
  - Helps receiver (UE or gNB) estimate the channel for equalization and demodulation
  - Only reference signal in NR tightly coupled with data (PDSCH/PUSCH)
  - DMRS configuration depends on numerology (symbol spacing)
  - More DMRS symbols possible with shorter slots
| Task                       | Responsible Layer |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| DMRS configuration         | RRC Layer         |
| Activation for PDSCH/PUSCH | MAC Layer         |
| Generation & Transmission  | PHY Layer         |

**Precoding and Precoder Matrix**
- Precoding applies spatial filtering to boost performance and reduce interference
- Done at transmitter side (gNB/UE)

| Function                 | Description                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Spatial Multiplexing     | Supports multiple layers              |
| Beamforming              | Focus energy directionally            |
| Interference Suppression | Reduces inter-layer interference      |
| Reliability              | Improves SINR and spectral efficiency |


| Scenario     | Precoding Usage      |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| gNB → PDSCH  | Yes (Beamforming)    |
| UE → PUSCH   | Yes, if UL MIMO used |
| SRS feedback | gNB selects PMI      |
| CSI-RS       | UE selects best PMI  |

- UE doesn’t need to know the precoding matrix to decode PDSCH
- PRBs can be grouped into PRG (Precoding Resource Group)

### PDCCH
**Generation Process:**
```
MAC Layer → Configures parameters via RRC (e.g., CORESET, SearchSpace)
         ↓
MAC Layer → Determines DCI content (e.g., scheduling, MCS, HARQ, resource allocation)
         ↓
PHY Layer → Encodes DCI into PDCCH data (Polar encoding + QPSK modulation)
         ↓
PHY Layer → Transmits PDCCH over CORESET resources (according to Search Space configuration)

```
- Core Purpose of PDCCH:
  - PDCCH carries DCI (Downlink Control Information), which is encapsulated within PDCCH and transmitted to the UE.
  - Downlink scheduling:
    - Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)
    - Resource allocation (PRBs)
    - Slot/timing information
    - HARQ-related parameters (e.g., Redundancy Version)
  - Uplink scheduling grant:
    - MCS
    - Resource allocation
    - HARQ retransmission parameters

**Downlink Control Information**
- DCI (Downlink Control Information) is a control message sent by the gNB to inform the UE how to receive or transmit data.
- What Information is Included in DCI? DCI content depends on the format,

  - RRC configuration
  - PUCCH feedback
  - For SPS mode, HARQ-ACK may bypass PDCCH
- HARQ-ACK Transmission
  - Dynamic Codebook
  - One-shot response
- Timing Configuration
  - Semi-static via RRC
  - Dynamic via DCI


 
**PUSCH Scheduling**
- PUSCH can be scheduled in two ways:  
  -  Via DCI on PDCCH
  -  Via RRC-configured semi-static grant
  -  For semi-static grant, two operation modes exist:
    -  The first PUSCH is triggered by DCI, with subsequent transmissions following RRC and DCI configuration
    -  Or the PUSCH is triggered by data arrival in the UE's transmit buffer and follows the RRC configuration
 
**Physical uplink control channel**
- PUCCH has five formats, depending on the duration and UCI payload size:

| Format    | Length                 | UCI Payload              | UE Multiplexing                                   | Description                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Format #0 | 1 or 2 symbols (short) | Small (up to 2 bits)     | Up to 6 UEs (with 1-bit payload)                  | For very short control feedback                |
| Format #1 | 4–14 symbols (long)    | Small (up to 2 bits)     | Up to 84 UEs (no hopping) / 36 UEs (with hopping) | Provides better reliability and coverage       |
| Format #2 | 1 or 2 symbols (short) | Large (more than 2 bits) | **No** multiplexing supported                     | For short-duration but large control messages  |
| Format #3 | 4–14 symbols (long)    | Large (more than 2 bits) | **No** multiplexing supported                     | For high-capacity control signaling            |
| Format #4 | 4–14 symbols (long)    | Moderate                 | Multiplexing up to 4 UEs                          | Balanced between payload size and multiplexing |

**Difference Between Short and Long PUCCH**
- Short PUCCH (≤ 2 bits):Uses sequence selection
- Short PUCCH (> 2 bits):Uses frequency multiplexing of UCI and DMRS
- Long PUCCH:
  - Uses time multiplexing of UCI and DMRS
  - May support repetition across multiple slots or sub-slots (configured via DCI or semi-static RRC)
 
**PUCCH Priority Index**
- A UE can have up to two PUCCH configurations in one group:
  - One for priority index 0 (low)
  - One for priority index 1 (high)
 
**UCI Multiplexing Conditions**
- UCI Multiplexing in PUCCH:
  - When multiple UCIs are sent simultaneously with the same priority (high/low)
  - When HARQ-ACK (low priority) and UCI (high priority) coincide in time with matching priorities
 
- UCI Multiplexing in PUSCH:
  - When PUSCH and UCI coincide in time due to:
    - UL-SCH transport block transmission
    - A-CSI triggered transmission without UL-SCH TB
  - HARQ-ACK and UCI of different priorities may still be multiplexed when coinciding in time

**UCI May Contain**
- CSI (Channel State Information)
- ACK/NACK
- Scheduling Request


**Channel Coding for Uplink Control Information**
| UCI size including CRC | Channel code type |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1 bit                  | Repetition code   |
| 2 bits                 | Simplex code      |
| 3–11 bits              | Reed Muller code  |
| >11 bits               | Polar code        |

**Random access**
- Four supported PRACH sequence lengths:

| Length | Supported Subcarrier Spacings | Restrictions                                                  |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 839    | 1.25 kHz, 5 kHz               | Restricted to Type A/B sets, licensed spectrum only           |
| 139    | 15–960 kHz                    | Unrestricted sets, for both licensed and shared spectrum      |
| 571    | 30 kHz, 120 kHz               | Unrestricted sets only                                        |
| 1151   | 15–480 kHz                    | Unrestricted sets, for FR1: shared only; FR2: licensed/shared |

- PRACH Configuration:
  - Multiple PRACH preamble formats are defined, based on:
    - Number of OFDM symbols
    - Cyclic prefix (CP) and guard time
  - PRACH configuration is provided to the UE via system information (e.g., SIB1)

- UE Behavior:
  - The UE determines PRACH transmit power for retransmission based on:
    - Estimated path loss
    - Power ramping counter
  - System Information provides rules for:
    - Associating SSB with RACH resources
    - RSRP threshold for SSB selection, configurable by the network
      
### 5.5 Transport Channels
| Downlink Transport Channels | Uplink Transport Channels | Sidelink Transport Channels (UE-UE) |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **BCH**: Fixed format, broadcast transmission<br>**DL-SCH**: Supports HARQ, AMC, beamforming, DRX<br>**PCH**: Used for paging, supports DRX, dynamically uses resources | **UL-SCH**: Supports HARQ, AMC, beamforming<br>**RACH**: Used for PRACH random access, high collision risk | **SL-BCH**: Fixed format broadcast<br>**SL-SCH**: Supports unicast, groupcast, broadcast:-

### 5.6 Shared Spectrum Access

- Uses **LBT (Listen Before Talk)** to sense whether the channel is idle.
- If the UE detects consecutive LBT failures, it must report via **MAC CE** or trigger a **Scheduling Request (SR)**.
- Can switch UL BWP or trigger RACH.
- **CAPC (Channel Access Priority Class)**:
  - Defines the priority order for MAC CE and RLC bearer.
  - Maps to different CAPC values (1 to 4) based on **5QI**, with smaller numbers indicating higher priority.
